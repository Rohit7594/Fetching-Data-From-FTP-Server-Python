## Problem - If you are tired of manually downloading same kind of data every month from FTP. Then you can use this python code to reduce your task and save your precious time. 

In my case, I have to download wind turbines 10min data for previous month for preparing reports. But at times because of connection issue downloading it directly from system or using any third party apps and doing same task every month is irritating. So I wrote a code to deal with it.

Please have a look at it and suggest if something more can be done or anything part can be done in more efficient ways. Offcourse Its a quick lines of code will try to give a gui in future :)
